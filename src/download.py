"""Download the Toronto Centreline (TCL) GeoJSON from the Open Data portal.

Mirrors the smart-cache pattern of the sibling toronto-addresses-layer project:
a HEAD request compares Last-Modified + Content-Length against a small JSON
sidecar, and the file is only re-fetched when those change.

Every request is gated on a usable link first (``addressvault.net``, the same
gate the address vault pulls behind). The weekly trigger is what makes that
worth doing: a run lost to a dead link is not retried until next Monday, and on
2026-07-27 both this task and the parks sibling died exactly that way -- an
unhandled getaddrinfo traceback. A link that dies mid-body now resumes instead
of costing the whole download.
