"""Publish build/site/ to the orphan gh-pages branch (single commit, force-push).

The tile pyramid is hundreds of thousands of files. To avoid copying them all
into a worktree, this stages them in place with a temporary index and
GIT_WORK_TREE, builds an orphan commit with git plumbing, and force-pushes it.
Each publish replaces the branch tip, so repository history never grows.
